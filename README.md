Group Project Website - in HTML & CSS

This is a GROUP assignment.   Get the starting repository here:

Your goal is to "code" your website design in HTML5 and CSS for style and layout.  But no javascript (yet).

I do expect to see the full navigation, the home page, all product/resource pages, and intermediate pages.  And I want you to be able to present your site (screen share) by class time Tuesday October 24th.  Feedback will be given and you will have till the evening of the 26th to submit your assignment.

I want you to be able to present your site (screen share) by class time on Tuesday the 24th. 

Some things I expect in addition to the site:

**File Organization** - files should be in directories within the **public** directory so as to allow easier file management.  Images should be within their own structure and product pages should be in their own directory.

**Meaningful Names** - files, thus the URL should have meaningful names to the user.

**Submission** - Should be in the assignments GitHub (all files/folders within your **public** directory).  And a writeup in PDF submitted to Canvas.  The PDF should include your team name, all the members of the teams names, the github userid for the submitted assignment and a description of what you did, problems encountered and how you solved then.  (only one person in the group needs to submit)

Don't forget to be able to present your site on November 7th during class!  No more than 5 minutes per group.
