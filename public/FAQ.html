                        <p>
                            First, shop for firm and shiny apples. Once you get them home, place unwashed apples away 
                            in your fridge until you are ready to eat them. Ensure apples are stored away from other fragrant fresh produce (like onions) 
                            as their odors can alter the taste of the fruit. Wash the fruit prior to eating and enjoy!

                    <p>
                        This is Kaolin clay, a natural material that we apply to protect apples (and pears too) from getting sunburned. 
                        Yup, even fruit can get sunburned! The clay reflects the sun preventing the burn. 
                        It’s usually washed off the fruit during packing but some residue can be left behind in the stem/bottom ends of the fruit, 
                        where the brushes don’t reach.

                    <p>
                        It’s not likely. It may produce a tree, but it probably won’t produce edible fruit. 
                        Fruit trees are grown by grafting a specific variety onto an established rootstock, so planting from a seed won’t 
                        get you the variety you are after. The best way to grow your own apples would be to purchase a tree from a local nursery.

                    <summary class="topicFaq">Will the apples that I get from the tree I grow taste just like apple that I got the seeds from?</summary>

                    <p>
                        No they will taste different.  Trees grown from seed are different from their parent, 
                        just like us, but in the case of apple trees they are typically very different than their parents. 
                        The only way to get the exact same tasting apple is by grafting a branch from the tree you like onto new root stock.
