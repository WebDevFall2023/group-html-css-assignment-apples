                    How do I store Stemilt apples for optimum quality?
                </label>

                <p class="answerFaq">
                    First, shop for firm and shiny apples. Once you get them home, place unwashed apples away 
                    in your fridge until you are ready to eat them. Ensure apples are stored away from other fragrant fresh produce (like onions) 
                    as their odors can alter the taste of the fruit. Wash the fruit prior to eating and enjoy!

                    Why is there wax on conventional apples?
                </label>
                <p class="answerFaq">
                    Freshly harvested apples have a natural wax coating that protects them from shriveling and moisture loss, 
                    however it is unfortunately removed when it is washed and scrubbed prior to being packed. On conventional apples, 
                    Stemilt replaces the natural wax with a thin layer of food-grade wax (which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) 
                    that is carnauba or shellac based. These waxes are natural, non-petroleum based coatings with no known allergens as ingredients, including: 
                    milk, soy, casein or gluten.

                    I spotted a white residue on the stem bowl of apple. What is it?
                </label>
                <p class="answerFaq">
                    This is Kaolin clay, a natural material that we apply to protect apples (and pears too) from getting sunburned. 
                    Yup, even fruit can get sunburned! The clay reflects the sun preventing the burn. 
                    It’s usually washed off the fruit during packing but some residue can be left behind in the stem/bottom ends of the fruit, 
                    where the brushes don’t reach.

                    I want to plant my apple seeds. Will it result in a tree and edible fruits?
                </label>
                <p class="answerFaq">
                    It’s not likely. It may produce a tree, but it probably won’t produce edible fruit. 
                    Fruit trees are grown by grafting a specific variety onto an established rootstock, so planting from a seed won’t 
                    get you the variety you are after. The best way to grow your own apples would be to purchase a tree from a local nursery.

                    How long will it take for my seedlings to bear fruit?
                </label>
                <p class="answerFaq">
                    Typically apple trees grown from seed take 8-10 years to bear.
                </p>
                <label for="Questions" class="topicFaq">
                    Will the apples that I get from the tree I grow taste just like apple that I got the seeds from?
                </label>
                <p class="answerFaq">
                    No they will taste different.  Trees grown from seed are different from their parent, 
                    just like us, but in the case of apple trees they are typically very different than their parents. 
                    The only way to get the exact same tasting apple is by grafting a branch from the tree you like onto new root stock.
